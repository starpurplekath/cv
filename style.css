what is javascript? What does it do?
It is a client side programming language, so it works in the web browser, not on a server. (Though apparently there is a version called node.js that works on the server side.) Unlike html and css which are "markup" languages, it can be used to make wevsites interactive, such as dynamically updating, doing calculations, manipulate data, animations. It is designed to work with html and css.
